# Tiny Foot

### Why tiny foot?

While going through the documentation of little foot, we realized stuff is too complicated, let's try making it simpler. Why not make a mini version of the original Bigfoot on which little foot is based?</br> 
Following Tim Peter's Zen of Python - *simple is better than complex*, we set out to create just that - the Tinyfoot - using nothing but vanilla JavaScript and plain CSS, no coffee script, no unnecessary frameworks, no fancy css - just the OGs that have stood the test of time.

# Bigfoot Project 

**Bigfoot** is a responsive SCSS-based styling system designed to enhance UI components, offering customizable elements like buttons, popovers, footers, and number displays.

### Features:
- **Customizable**: Modify variables in `bigfoot-variables.scss` for easy theme adjustments.
- **Reusable**: Utilize mixins from `bigfoot-mixins.scss` for consistent styling across your project.
- **Responsive**: Pre-built media queries ensure components adapt to all screen sizes.
