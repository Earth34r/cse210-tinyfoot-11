# The Littlefoot Review

## Design Decisions


### Code Organization and Quality

#### Code Quality

- Organization: The overall structure and code organization is high-quality. However, this repo has only basic level of directory structure, with core modules and DOM-related scripts. Additionally, it doesn't separate different modules in individual TypeScript files and all defined types in an independent script, which makes the maintainance and development difficult.

- Code comments: Despite the type, class, and function names are straightforward, **ZERO** code comments make it difficult for developers who are not familiar with this project to understand the functionality and  perform further developments on top of the code.

#### Functionality and Organization

- Entry Point: `src/littlefoot.ts`, defines the primary entry point of the application with input arguments on user settings, making it easy to import with developer's customization. 
  
- Logics and Constants: `src/use-cases.ts` and `src/settings.ts` define types `UseCaseSettings`, `Footnote`, and `UseCases`. `UseCaseSettings` is a template for developers to manage footnotes. `Footnote` is the object with methods for activation, dismissal and `UseCases` is for methods for various footnote operations. `src/settings.ts` is for application-specific constants. Overall, this code exhibits high quality in terms of strong typing and providing a single source for the feature implementation and constants, making it easy for maintainability and customizations. 

- DOM Handling:  
  - Document: `dom/document.ts` defines actions performed on footnote document, including activate, dismiss, reposition, resize, toggle, hover, etc. 
  - Footnote Structure: `dom/footnote.ts` defines behaviors of footnote actions. 
  - Events for User Interface: `dom/events.ts` defines footnote-specific events for user interactions, and are listening to the mouse and key input events.
  

#### Styling

- CSS: `src/littlefoot.css`

#### Build and Configuration

- Build Configuration:  
  - `rollup.config.js`
  - `tsconfig.json`

#### Testing

- Unit Tests: `test/`, the unit tests provided allow the developers to easily test the components and functions of LittleFoot by comparing their actual behavior with the expected behavior.

- End-to-End Tests: `cypress/e2e/`, the end-to-end tests provide another level of testing to ensure the correct overall workflow of LittleFoot by simulating real-world user scenarios.

#### Development Tools: 

- Development Config: `biome.json`

#### Documentation

- Project Documentation:  `README.md`

#### Packages

- Package Management: `package.json`


### Pattern and Language Use

- TypeScript is a modern, actively maintained language that enhances JavaScript development.
