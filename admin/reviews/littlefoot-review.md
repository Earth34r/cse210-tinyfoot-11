# The Littlefoot Review

## Design Decisions


### Code Organization and Quality

#### Code Quality

- Organization: The overall structure and code organization is high-quality. However, this repo has only basic level of directory structure, with core modules and DOM-related scripts. Additionally, it doesn't separate different modules in individual TypeScript files and all defined types in an independent script, which makes the maintainance and development difficult.

- Code comments: Despite the type, class, and function names are straightforward, **ZERO** code comments make it difficult for developers who are not familiar with this project to understand the functionality and  perform further developments on top of the code.

#### Functionality and Organization

- Entry Point: `src/littlefoot.ts`, defines the primary entry point of the application with input arguments on user settings, making it easy to import with developer's customization. 
  
- Logics and Constants: `src/use-cases.ts` and `src/settings.ts` define types `UseCaseSettings`, `Footnote`, and `UseCases`. `UseCaseSettings` is a template for developers to manage footnotes. `Footnote` is the object with methods for activation, dismissal and `UseCases` is for methods for various footnote operations. `src/settings.ts` is for application-specific constants. Overall, this code exhibits high quality in terms of strong typing and providing a single source for the feature implementation and constants, making it easy for maintainability and future development. 

- DOM Handling:  
  - Document: `dom/document.ts` defines actions performed on footnote document, including activate, dismiss, reposition, resize, toggle, hover, etc. 
  - Footnote Structure: `dom/footnote.ts` defines behaviors of footnote actions. 
  - Events for User Interface: `dom/events.ts` defines footnote-specific events for user interactions, and are listening to the mouse and key input events.
  
  Overall, the DOM codes exhibit a clear seperation of functionality. 
  

#### Styling
