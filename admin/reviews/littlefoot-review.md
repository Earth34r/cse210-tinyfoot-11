# The Littlefoot Review

## Design Decisions


### Code Organization and Quality

#### Code Quality

- Organization: The overall structure and code organization is high-quality for a nodejs-based TypeScript project. However, this repo has only basic level of directory structure, with core modules and DOM-related scripts. Additionally, it doesn't separate different modules in individual TypeScript files and all defined types in an independent script, which makes the maintainance and development difficult. These scripts can be further modularized into smaller units for easy maintainance and developments.

- Code comments: Despite the type, class, and function names are straightforward, **ZERO** code comments make it difficult for developers who are not familiar with this project to understand the functionality and  perform further developments on top of the code.

#### Functionality and Organization

- Entry Point: `src/littlefoot.ts`, defines the primary entry point of the application with input arguments on user settings, making it easy to import with developer's customization. 
  
- Logics and Constants: `src/use-cases.ts` and `src/settings.ts` define types `UseCaseSettings`, `Footnote`, and `UseCases`. `UseCaseSettings` is a template for developers to manage footnotes. `Footnote` is the object with methods for activation, dismissal and `UseCases` is for methods for various footnote operations. `src/settings.ts` is for application-specific constants. Overall, this code exhibits high quality in terms of strong typing and providing a single source for the feature implementation and constants, making it easy for maintainability and customizations. 

- DOM Handling:  
  - Document: `dom/document.ts` defines actions performed on footnote document, including activate, dismiss, reposition, resize, toggle, hover, etc. 
  - Footnote Structure: `dom/footnote.ts` defines behaviors of footnote actions. 
  - Events for User Interface: `dom/events.ts` defines footnote-specific events for user interactions, and are listening to the mouse and key input events.
  

#### Styling

- CSS: `src/littlefoot.css`

#### Build and Configuration

- Build Configuration:  
  - `rollup.config.js`
  - `tsconfig.json`

#### Testing

- Unit Tests: the unit tests provided in `test/` allow the developers to easily test the components and functions of LittleFoot by comparing their actual behavior with the expected behavior.

- End-to-End Tests: the end-to-end tests in `cypress/e2e/` provide another level of testing to ensure the correct overall workflow of LittleFoot by simulating real-world user scenarios.

#### Development Tools: 

- Development Config: `biome.json` is included for configuration of Biome module for development.

#### Documentation

- Project Documentation: `README.md` gives developers a clear view and instruction about how to install and use the scripts. 

#### Packages

- Package Management: overall, `package.json` provides the necessary packages to run LittleFoot under nodejs environment and the scripts are easy to use and well documented. However, it is still worth to note that 1) the scripts only work on Linux or Unix-based machines and don't work on Windows machines, and 2) there is no script to create a simple demo for testing, which makes developers' testing process difficult. 


### Pattern and Language Use

- TypeScript is a modern, actively maintained language that enhances JavaScript development. The strong typing of TypeScript guarantees the correct functionality and robustness for JavaScript. 


### Modules


### Tool Quality


## Final Verdict

Overall, the LittleFoot repository demonstrates that its developer has abundant experience and expertise in handling Node.js-based TypeScript projects. LittleFoot provides well-defined settings functionality that makes customization simple. However, it is clear that the developer did not consider making it easy for other developers to maintain and build upon this project. The lack of comments and poor directory structure obviously prevent others from understanding its code.
