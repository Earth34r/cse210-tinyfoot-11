# ADR: Modularize the CoffeeScript to Replace Functions with Raw Javascript in LittleFoot

## Context and Problem Statement

We have already decided migrate Bigfoot for our project. To tackle with Bigfoot's outdated tools and codes, like CoffeeScript and SCSS, we proposed to migrate it to JavaScript and CSS. In this meeting, the team is discussing the progress and deciding the next step of migration. 

## Decision Drivers

* Disorganized codes of BigFoot

  After reading the code organizations of BigFoot, the team noticed that BigFoot is disorganized. Despite of the well-documented and well-commented codes of BigFoot, all the scripts, functions, and types are packed in the same `bigfoot.coffee` file, which makes further development hard.

* Outdated and deprecated tools

  Some of the team members struggled to run BigFoot on their devices, which reflected that CoffeeScript and SCSS are deprecated and outdated tools for web development. A renovating and updating processing should be performed to make it functional and catch up with the latest web frameworks.

* Team members are not experienced with web development


## Considered Options

* Option A: Convert CoffeeScript function one-by-one to JavaScript function

  #### Description:

  This option includes re-writing the CoffeeScript functions manually to JavaScript and then using the converting tool on CoffeeScript website to verify the CoffeeScript function to JavaScript function.

  #### Pros:

  This is the most straightforward method for converting. The results can be tested and verified to make sure the correctness.

  #### Cons:

  This may require some extra tools and advanced knowledge in writing JavaScript codes. Team members are not experienced in programming with JavaScript. Errors may occur in the conversions.
  
* Option B: Modularize the JavaScript files directly from CoffeeScript outputs 

  #### Description:

  This option includes using generated JavaScripts files from the CoffeeScript functions, and manually replace and modularize to JavaScript functions. Then we can use the converting tool on CoffeeScript website to verify the CoffeeScript function to JavaScript function.

  #### Pros:

  This is the most straightforward method for converting and suitable for team members without advanced JavaScript knowledge. The results can also be tested and verified to make sure the correctness.

  #### Cons:

  Errors may occur in the conversions since team members are not experienced with JavaScript.  
  
* Option C: Convert SCSS to CSS

  #### Description:

  This option includes using converting SCSS to CSS one by one. 

  #### Pros:

  The conversion process is straightforward and easy to complete for team members without advanced web development knowledge.


  #### Cons:

  The results cannot be verified since we have some troubles to compile and run it on our machines.


## Decision Outcome

>> Chosen Option: Option B and C

We have chosen Option B for converting CoffeeScript to JavaScript, leveraging the CoffeeScript-generated outputs due to our team's limited JavaScript expertise. This approach also allows for straightforward verification and testing of modularization. For SCSS conversions, we opted for Option C, as it aligns well with the team's skills and is simple to complete.
